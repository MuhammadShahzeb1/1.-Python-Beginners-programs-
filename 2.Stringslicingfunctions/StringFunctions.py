# if there is no space between words than its alphanumeric or alpha

# This function will check that is string is alphanumeric or not and return boolean True or False
print(mystr.isalnum())

#  This function will check that is string is alphabatic or not and return boolean True or False
print(mystr.isalpha())

# This function will check is this string ends with this(xyz) word
print(mystr.endswith("functions"))  # will return True

print(mystr.capitalize())

#This function will find the text word or alphabet in a long string  and return index value
print(mystr.find("b"))
print(mystr.find("going")) # will show the first letters index like 22

There are so many built in functions and we can use them when required
if we want to perfrom something we have to make sure that we have built in functions or not 
if we have built in functions it can work better and increase productivity as well

WE CAN FIND BUILT IN FUNCTIONS ON THIS WEBSITE   https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp
